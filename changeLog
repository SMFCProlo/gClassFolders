//Log of changes, with update instructions

// gClassFolders V2.1.2
// Changes made to functions used to move folders in school mode, improving reliability.
// Added archiving feature for archiving a single class at a time.

// gClassFolders V2.1.1
// Fixed bug introduced in V2.1.0 that prevented bulk operations from working properly

// gClassFolders V2.1.0
// Fixed issues with CacheService getting called for every string stored for the folder labels and internationalization.
// Significantly reduced runtime for school mode

// gClassFolders V2.0.4
// Fixed issue with scriptProperties getting called too many times in short succession during folder creation process.

// gClassFolders V2.0.2
// Fixed issue with internationalization file causing errors for students when they receive email link to move their folders.
// 
// Update steps: (only necessary for folks running in school mode)  
//1)  Copy contents of insternationalization file from V2.0.2 and paste over your existing internationalization file.  
//2)  Republish a new version of the web app by going to File -> Manage Versions and saving a new version.  
//3)  Go to Publish menu and republish the web app with the new version number.  Make sure the web app is published to run
// as the logged in user, and that anyone on the domain can run it.

// gClassFolders V3.0
// Stripped out school mode and internationalization
// Stripped out all ScriptDB dependencies
// Stripped out institutional tracking analytics (left in place anonymous analytics)
// Replaced all soon-to-be deprecated DocsList methods with DriveApp methods
// Converted all properties methods to new PropertiesService
// Put in place rudiments for converting to a "language pack" approach to internationalization
// To do: All strings must be abstracted as properties of the global LANG object defined the 
// topmost file of this project before internationalization can work.  Time consuming and not within the scope of this release.
